# Mycitrus App Interface V3

## Summary

This is the third prototype for the interface of the mycitrus app that I am working on. I have redesigned the entire interface around a new image carousel and a new scrolling headline zone.

## Build

This app uses React Native and the Expo managed workflow created with the blank template(non-typescript).

## Final Comments and Notes

- There is no page switch capabilities in this early prototype
- All infomation is premade in JSON data files
